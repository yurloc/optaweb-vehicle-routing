== Quickstart

=== Before you begin

==== Internet access

You need internet access when you build and run the application.
The application source code depends on Maven and NPM packages that will be downloaded during build.
When the application runs it uses third party, public services such as link:https://www.openstreetmap.org/about[OpenStreetMap]
to display map tiles and provide search results.

==== Routing data

The routing engine needs geographical data to calculate the time it takes vehicles to travel between locations.
The data need to be downloaded and stored on the local file system first.
Choose a region, for example Massachusetts, Belgium or India, and download it from http://download.geofabrik.de/.
The OSM data files are large, typically from 100 MB to 1 GB, and take some time to download so it is a good idea to begin with this step before building or starting the application.

==== Data directory structure

The application reads and writes several types of data on the file system.
It reads OSM files from the `openstreetmap` directory, writes a road network graph to the `graphhopper` directory and persists user data in a directory called `db`.
We recommend to create a new directory that will be dedicated to storing all of these data.
It'll make it easier for you to upgrade to a newer version of the application and continue working with the data you have created previously.

Start by creating the `openstreetmap` directory somewhere in your user account's home directory. For example:

[source]
----
$HOME/.vrp
└── openstreetmap
----

Move all your downloaded OSM files (`.osm.pbf`) to the `openstreetmap` directory.
The rest of the directory structure will be created by the application when it is run for the first time.
It may look like this:

// TODO maybe replace this with a screenshot, doesn't look good in PDF.
[source]
----
$HOME/.vrp
├── db
│   └── vrp.mv.db
├── graphhopper
│   └── belgium-latest
└── openstreetmap
    └── belgium-latest.osm.pbf
----

==== Air distance mode

The application can work in a routing mode that calculates travel times based on air distance approximation.
Use this mode in situations where you need to get the application up and running as quickly as possible.
Air distance mode is only useful if you need to smoke-test the application and you don't need accurate travel times.

==== Java

Make sure you have Java SE 8 or higher installed on your system.
// TODO Java 11
If you have a binary distribution of the application, you only need the Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE).
If you want to build the application from source, Java SE Development Kit (JDK) needs to by installed on your system.
Installing JDK is recommended.

To install OpenJDK 8 on Fedora, run:

[source,shell]
----
sudo dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
----

=== Get the application

If you don't have the application on your computer yet, download a distribution archive from OptaPlanner website.
The distribution archive is a good way to quickly evaluate the application without having to set up build tools.
Java is all you need.
// TODO cross-reference
If you want to modify the application and build it yourself or contribute back to upstream, head over to the Development chapter.

To download the latest final release of OptaWeb Vehicle Routing, go to https://www.optaplanner.org/download/download.html
and click *Download OptaWeb Vehicle Routing*.

Unpack the downloaded distribution ZIP file.
It contains both sources and binary build of the application and the complete documentation you are reading now.

=== Run the application

Use the `run.sh` script to run the application.
It needs three arguments to run:

- the data directory,
- the OSM file name to use,
- a country code used to filter search queries.

Provided you want to start the application with Belgium and you have downloaded `belgium-latest.osm.pbf` from Geofabrik, use the run script like this:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run.sh ~/.vrp/ belgium-latest.osm.pbf BE
----

Alternatively, you can start in air distance mode by running the script without arguments and confirming the decision to start in air distance mode.

=== Build the application

If you don't have a runnable distribution of the application,
for example you have just cloned the Git repository from https://github.com/kiegroup/optaweb-vehicle-routing,
you need to build the project before you can run the application.
To build the application, change directory to the root of the project with the `mvnw` script file:

[source,bash]
----
cd optaweb-vehicle-routing
----

and run Maven build:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
----

For more information on building the application, see Development chapter.
